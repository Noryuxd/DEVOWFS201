## About

A revolutionary recruitment platform that transforms the traditional job search process by empowering recruiters to proactively search for and connect with qualified job seekers.
Unlike conventional job boards where the onus is on job seekers to apply for positions, WorkIT flips the paradigm, allowing recruiters to search for candidates based on their specific requirements and directly initiate the recruitment process.
